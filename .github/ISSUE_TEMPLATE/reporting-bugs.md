## Reporting Bugs

Please file bugs in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/qefKH3up/BIT608_A2/issues). Include at
least the following:

 - What happened.

 - What did you expect to happen instead of what *did* happen, if it's
   not crazy obvious.

 - What operating system, operating system version and bitness you are using. 

 - The same for other connected devices, where relevant.

 - What hardware â€“ CPU, memory and type of storage (SSD or spindle) you are using.

 - Screenshot if the issue concerns something visible in the GUI.

- Console log entries, error messages and error codes where possible and relevant.

If you're not sure whether something is relevant, erring on the side of
too much information will never get you yelled at. :)
